## Improvements:
- Adding more accessibility features (translation, extracted string resources, content descriptions, etc) is always important to reach more users.
- Cleaning up the adapter logic would have been helpful (who is responsible for formatted the data? adapter/viewmodel/etc?)
- Giving the application a more united feeling by adapting to a common style for the entire application.
- Adding more robust protections when accessing the web api such as checking for timeouts/network connections/etc.
